# mandatory-web-shop

New features in mandatory 3:

- Added the ability to view all products individually 
- Added the ability for customers to leave and read reviews (You leave reviews through a modal using Bootstrap 3 btw)
- Reworked form validation with jquery and now includes all inputfields instead of being 3 different functions (phew).

Woop woop!
