# mandatory-web-shop v4

New stuff in this version:

 - All products are now fetched from the edument API.
 - The same goes for the reviews of the items.
 - Customers can now press "purchase" and their order will be sent in to the API once all
 fields have been validated.
 
 Random stuff to know about the code:
 
 - The new reviews are shown _once the modal is closed_
